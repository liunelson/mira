Scenario 5: The Lac Operon (Workbench Only) *
Estimated % of time: Workbench 15%
*This scenario is meant to be conducted by workbench modelers only. There is no baseline for this scenario. This scenario will not be presented in the Decision-maker Panel.
In E. Coli, lactose metabolism is regulated by a group of genes called the lac operon. This group is a sequence of six genes that do the following (and are described in Figure 4):
• The last three genes (z, y, a) in the sequence are transcribed and translated into three enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of lactose (which allows bacteria to use the sugar lactose as an energy source):
i. 𝛽-galactosidase (synthesized from gene z), which degrades lactose by splinng it into glucose and galactose
ii. lactose permease (synthesized from gene y), a protein that transports lactose into the cell
iii. transacetylase (synthesized from gene a), which has a smaller, supporIng role in the metabolism process
• The first three genes (i, p, o) regulate enzyme producIon:
i. Gene i is transcribed and translated into a protein called the lac repressor
ii. When lactose is not present in the environment, the lac repressor binds to gene o (the operator gene), and blocks RNA polymerase (RNAP) from binding to gene p (the promoter gene) to start the transcripIon of genes z, y, and a, menIoned above.
iii. When lactose is present, it binds to the lac repressor and removes it from gene o, which then allows genes z, y, and a to be transcribed, and the enzymes 𝛽- galactosidase, lactose permease, and transacetylase, to be synthesized.
• Note that this is a somewhat simplified model, and in reality, the absence and presence of glucose also plays a role in regulaIng these processes.

1. Implement and simulate the dynamics of the lac operon as a regulatory network in a single cell, using parameter values from Table 2, and iniIal condiIons from Table 3, for a Ime period of 1000 seconds, and with the following condiIons:
24

a. Simulate the system when there is no lactose present in the environment (let [𝐿𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑠𝑒]: = 0 molecules/cell). Plot the mRNA and protein trajectories. When does 𝑍 reach peak concentraIon, and what is the peak concentraIon amount?
b. Simulate when there is lactose present in the environment (let [𝐿𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑠𝑒]: = 500 molecules/cell). Plot the mRNA and protein trajectories. When does 𝑍 reach peak concentraIon, and what is the peak concentraIon amount?
c. How does the 𝑍 trajectory in the presence of lactose, compare to its trajectory in the absence of lactose?
