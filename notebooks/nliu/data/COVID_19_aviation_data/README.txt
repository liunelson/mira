This datasets accompany the paper  "Capturing the Effects of Transportation on the Spread of COVID-19 with a Networked SEIR Model" by Damir Vrabac, Mingfeng Shang, Joseph Pham, Raphael Stern,  Philip E. Pare.

This dataset contains three directories, "Pre_processing", "Data", "Code", explained below.

"Pre_processing" is used for cleaning the COVID-19 data and transportation air network data. A detailed README can be found in that directory. This is included for completeness, but all data has been processed in the "Data" directory.


"Data" contains output (fully processed) datasets. You may reproduce the files in "Data" with the programming scripts in "Pre_processing" or "Codes"


"Code" contains the code to calibrate and simulate the SEIR model presented in the above manuscript.
